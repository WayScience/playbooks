Sharing resources is fundamental to advancing biomedical research.
We share code, software, analyses, results, and data (or data access instructions) using Github.
Our Github page is here: <https://github.com/WayScience>

We use several principles when creating, contributing to, and sharing github repositories.
Each of these principles are slightly different depending on the kind of github repository.
There are three categories of github repositories, each with specific design patterns:

1. Software

2. Analysis

3. Data

We will outline each of the three below.

For each repository, we practice ‚Äúpull request peer review‚Äù, which we also outline below.

## 1. Three different kinds of Github repositories

### 1. Software repository

When people think about github, they usually think about open source software packages.
The lab often produces individual pieces of software that we and the community use as tools.
We follow standard procedures when writing software packages including:

- Language-specific file structure and organization

- Portable to packaging engines (e.g. pip, conda)

- Maximal test coverage with continuous integration (using GitHub actions)

- Consistent functional API

- Well-documented README introducing the software

- Full auto-doc generating a complete read-the-docs page (e.g. sphinx)

- Gallery outlining example use cases

Examples: [pycytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer), [CytoSnake](https://github.com/WayScience/CytoSnake)

### 2. Analysis repository

As biomedical data scientists, analysis repositories are the most common type of repository for our group.
When most people think about a github repository, they are likely not thinking about storing a reproducible analysis.
Nevertheless, this approach is gaining in popularity.¬†

An analysis repository contains a collection of analyses linked together by the name of the project, which should be descriptive of the specific set of interrelated hypotheses.

Analysis repositories contain numbered folders, or modules, that have a sequential relationship. For example, the first step in most analysis repositories is data access.
Therefore, the first module is often called \`0.download-data\`, and it contains instructions on how to access the data you use in your analysis.
The subsequent modules all use these data in various ways; often exploring the data or testing various hypotheses.
We also include code for generating all publication quality figures as the last module.¬†

We use software libraries in these analyses, and we save specific versions in conda environment files or docker containers.
We also must specify the license, present a clear README with reproducibility/usage instructions, a brief summary of the results, and citation instructions.

Analysis repositories must be included in our publications, and we consider them to be the ground truth methods section. The analyses must be fully reproducible (we aim for [Gold Reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01256-7#Sec4)) and open source.
For each submission and subsequent resubmission, we generate specific ‚Äúgithub releases‚Äù.
We generate direct object identifiers (DOI) for these releases using Zenodo ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)).
We do not restrict ourselves to the one-repository per-paper strategy, instead, we opt for the one-release per-submission strategy (which can span multiple publications).¬†

Examples: [phenotypic\_profiling\_model](https://github.com/WayScience/phenotypic_profiling_model), [gene\_dependency\_representations](https://github.com/WayScience/gene_dependency_representations)

### 3. Data repository

In many projects, we collaborate with labs that generate data directly, and it is up to us to apply bioinformatics pipelines to generate analysis-ready data.
We also often re-analyze existing, publicly available data (e.g. the resources on [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)).
In these cases, we use a third github repository design: A data repository.

The data repository contains two key elements: 1) A bioinformatics pipeline, or recipe, of all computational steps applied to the data and 2) the data, or pointers to the data.
We strive to release all of our bioinformatics steps and data publicly so that others (and ourselves!) can benefit.
We believe that version controlling both our pipeline and data is essential for reproducibility, and so that we (and others) understand exactly what steps generated all intermediate files.
We also make sure that this link between the pipeline and data is itself version-controlled, so that data processing steps do not lose sync in re-analysis.

This process ensures that our data can be easily reprocessed by updated bioinformatics methods with new and improved methods.

Examples: [cell-health-data](https://github.com/WayScience/cell-health-data), [nf1_cellpainting_data](https://github.com/WayScience/nf1_cellpainting_data), [CFReT_data](https://github.com/WayScience/CFReT_data).

## 2. Considerations for each kind of Github repository

There are important considerations to make when creating, contributing, and sharing GitHub repositories. **Table 1** below describes these considerations.

## 3. Github repositories as lab notebooks

We use GitHub repositories functionally as electronic lab notebooks.¬†¬†

## 4. Pull request peer review

The contributor can only merge code into WayScience (or affiliate \[e.g., Cytomining]) repositories after it is approved by at least one Way lab arborist. ‚úÖ

This process has many direct and indirect benefits.


### Direct benefits of pull request review

- Only high-quality, understandable code exists in the WayScience GitHub organization.

- We minimize future pain involved with perpetuating bugs over time (i.e., technical debt) which will lead to inaccurate or misleading interpretations.¬†

  - While pull request review slows progress in the short term, the added benefits of sustainability more than make up for this time lost in the long term.


### Indirect benefits of pull request review

#### To the scientist writing the code (the writer)

- Adds accountability, which encourages higher quality and more accurate analyses.

- Encourages committing early and often, which reduces the chance of unintentional code deletion


#### To the scientist reviewing the code (the reviewer)

- Adds accountability, which also encourages higher quality work.

- Learning something new and upgrading their skills.

- Remaining up to date on the progress of the project, which increases collaboration and comradery in the Lab.


### Step-by-step process

1. The writer files a **small, bite-sized** pull request ü™•

   - This happens from a cloned fork of the WayScience repository

   - The smaller the better; it is WAY easier to review if small

2. The writer adds details to the pull request in markdown format

   - Justifies the rationale for why the pull request exists

   - \[Optional] Encourages the reviewer to pay particular attention to any aspect

   - If the pull request contains a figure, add the figure

3. The writer posts a link to the pull request to the #pull-request-review discord channel

   - Often, the writer knows who should take a look. Tag this person.

4. The reviewer will see the post on the discord channel and determine if they can (and are suitable) to review

   - The reviewer can post to the discord channel claiming the review

5. The reviewer will review the pull request

   - Review with the desire:

     - A) understanding

     - B) to improve your peer‚Äôs code

     - C) accuracy, in this order

   - Review to pass along tips along any of the above axes

   - **Note:** Standards change over time, and we set our own standards internally.
   We do not prescribe a standard beyond the three items above.

6. The reviewer will submit their review

   - This review may, or may not, include an approval ‚úÖ

7. Regardless of approval, the writer will respond to the reviewers comments (if there are any), and a discussion may ensue.

   - **Note**: Most often, the writer is the project owner.
   This means they have final say in what changes are incorporated.

     - In rare cases, if there is a disagreement that cannot be resolved, involve the PI.

8. After approval, the writer will squash+merge the pull request into main
